# COVID-Jupyter-ML
Analysis of COVID data using Machine Learning algorithms on Jupyter

In this paper, me and my team in the M.S. in I.T. Data Analytics course used a Covid data set to identify relationships betwen factors such as age and 
preexisting conditions and death or hospitalization. We used a populat Kaggle database - “Covid-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Dataset.” www.kaggle.com/arashnic/covid19-case-surveillance-public-use-dataset.  
We made sure to clean the dataset thoroughly removing empty fields and unnecessary colums.
We determined with an accuracy of an average 80% the correlation between our chosen variables, results consistent with similar research.
